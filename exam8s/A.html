	<p>As the Chinese saying goes: live in sorrow and die in peace. This sentence inspired me a lot. And the knowledge I learned also gave me an education like this. 
        Mencius, a Confucian classic, has the following sentence: If there is no wise man and assists the king at in the country, There are no foreign countries to compete with and foreign invasions, and such countries often perish.
        And the lessons of the Tang Dynasty can give us similar experiences. Tang Xuanzong, an emperor of the Tang Dynasty, made some improvements that made the Tang Dynasty rich and powerful. However, in the later years of his reign, the "Anshi Rebellion" broke out, which turned the Tang Dynasty from prosperity to decline. The reason for the outbreak of the "Anshi Rebellion" was because Tang Xuanzong thought that the world was too peaceful, and he did not go to the court for a long time .
        So, looking back on history can teach us a lesson, we don't need to be an emperor like Tang Xuanzong, but we can pay attention to these things in all aspects of life, so that we don't "die in peace".
